# SaleTracker-DiscordBot-Experiment

**Usage**
create a txt file named data at the path of main.py
Line 1 should contain your bot token 
line 2 server name that you're connecting the bot to (this can be left blank without errors (in my limited testing))

Add the bot to your discord server

**Commands**
!whatis term --urban dictionary lookup
!steamsale -- fetches when the next steam sale is
!test -- reponds *only used this to troubleshoot*
